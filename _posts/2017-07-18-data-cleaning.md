Today we're going to look at one common way of manipulating CSV and other flat data files. 
We'll look at a few more command line tools to do help us, and review how `paste` works once again. 

We'll look at a few different ways of converting a TSV file in to a CSV file.

Then we will look at the result of a compiled CSV file in a GUI environment, to be able to better understand what we're doing in the command line.

Here are some exercises:

## Translate, Edit, and Text-Processing

Use `tr`, `sed` and `awk` to change all the tabs in your TSV file to another separator character.{% sidenote 'convert' '"ANSWER: How do I convert a tab-separated values (TSV) file to a comma-separated values (CSV) file in BASH?," StackOverflow, Last updated 15 March 2017. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22419979/how-do-i-convert-a-tab-separated-values-tsv-file-to-a-comma-separated-values/22421445#22421445' %}

Figure out what these do and explain it to the class. 

## Editing on the command line

Use `vi` to open and match replace all the tab separators in your file. (Make sure to make a backup copy of your original file.)
