This will mean sending text to STDOUT and running other commands as part of the script that show the user what they are doing. </li>\n<li>Place a markdown version of a piece of original writing into your forked repository. This writing can be a poem, a short story, an essay: anything you wan, as long as it has some structure that can be marked up using Markdown. </li>\n<li>Test, tweak and then run your script to produce the four output formats listed above. </li>\n<li>Add, commit, and push all of your changes.</li>\n<li>Once you are satisfied with your outputs, create a new blog post on your website and include the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>A brief description (abstract) of your written work</li>\n<li>A description of what you did to get it into multiple formats</li>\n<li>Links to all of your source and output files, and your script.
